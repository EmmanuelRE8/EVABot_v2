# EmmaBot_v1

This repository hosts my interactive chatbot, EmmaBot_v1.   
It combines a **one-pager with KPIs, projects and skills** plus a **mini-chat app** where visitors can explore my experience through Q&A.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to move beyond a traditional CV and create an **interactive, data-driven way to present my career story**.  
Instead of only reading static text, recruiters and colleagues can **ask questions directly** to a mini-chatbot and explore:

- My professional impact (KPIs, automation gains, cross-functional projects).  
- Key tools and technologies I master (Python, SQL, Databricks, Tableau).  
- Leadership and adaptability skills across diverse teams and nationalities.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

- **Static site** hosted on GitHub Pages for free, accessible via QR.  
- **One-pager (`onepager.html`)** designed to summarize achievements and learning focus (printable as PDF).  
- **Mini-chat app (`index.html`)** built in vanilla JavaScript + CSS, fully client-side, no backend.  
- **Knowledge base (KB)** embedded directly in the app with my projects, skills and impact.  
- **Optional LLM mode** via `worker.js` on Cloudflare Workers, enabling AI-powered contextual answers without exposing API keys.
