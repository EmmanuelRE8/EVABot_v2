# PAIR — Personal AI Résumé 🤖

**PAIR** (*Personal AI Résumé*) is an interactive, AI-powered version of my professional journey.  
It combines a dynamic portfolio with conversational intelligence — allowing recruiters and peers  
to explore my projects, skills, and impact through natural dialogue.

### 🎯 Purpose

PAIR goes beyond a static CV — it demonstrates how Business Intelligence, Data, and AI  
can merge into a single interactive storytelling experience.

Instead of reading bullet points, visitors can:
- 💬 Chat with my virtual résumé to ask about projects, tools, or achievements.  
- 🔍 Explore **STAR-style** examples that highlight leadership, analytics, and innovation.  
- ⚙️ Experience a **real-world AI application** built with LLMs, Databricks, and BigQuery data.  

---

### 🧠 Built With
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (GitHub Pages)
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + Groq API (Llama 3.1)
- **Knowledge Base:** JSON sources (`profile.json`, `kb.json`, `star_bank.json`)
