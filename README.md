# E-V.A. bot (v2)

This repository hosts **E-V.A. bot**, an interactive chatbot that presents my career, projects, and skills in a dynamic way.  

It combines:  
- A **profile panel** with personal/professional details.  
- A **mini-chat app** where visitors can ask questions.

## 🌐 Live Access

- **Chat App (GitHub Pages):**

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of E-V.A. Bot is to go **beyond a traditional CV** and showcase my experience through an **interactive, AI-powered format**.  

Instead of just reading static text, recruiters and colleagues can:  
- **Ask questions** about my projects, skills, and impact.  
- Learn about my **career timeline, roles, and availability**.  
- Explore **STAR-style answers** to behavioral/soft skill questions.  
- See how BI/AI tools can be applied to storytelling in real-world career fairs.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

1. **Frontend (GitHub Pages)**  
   - `index.html` → A responsive web app (HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS).  
   - Loads `profile.json` (basic info, availability, work history).  
   - Loads `kb.json` (projects, impact, tools, soft skills).  
   - Loads `star_bank.json` (STAR answers for soft skills).  
   - Provides a clean **chat interface** for interaction.  

2. **Backend (Cloudflare Workers)**  
   - A Worker (`src/index.js`) handles incoming chat requests.  
   - It detects intent:  
     - *Profile questions* → uses `profile.json`.  
     - *STAR/soft skill questions* → uses `star_bank.json`.  
     - *Project/impact questions* → uses `kb.json`.  
   - Calls **Groq API** (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) via OpenAI-compatible endpoint.  
   - Returns concise, bullet-style answers.  
   - Uses CORS headers for public web access.  

3. **Data & Knowledge Base**  
   - `profile.json` → name, studies, experience, work history, preferences.  
   - `kb.json` → project portfolio, KPIs, actions, impacts, tools.  
   - `star_bank.json` → STAR responses (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Frontend → hosted free on **GitHub Pages**, accessible by QR code.  
   - Backend → deployed on **Cloudflare Workers** with environment secret `GROQ_API_KEY`.  
   - Integrated seamlessly: frontend sends chat queries to Worker, Worker calls Groq LLM + JSON sources, answers come back to the UI.
